## Event tags

Worlds can also have a range of different event-specific tags such as `admin_vrrat_community_takeover` for the Vket row, `admin_muzzfesst` for the MUZZFEST event, or `admin_halloween_2019` for the 2019 Halloween row. These are not listed because it would be impossible to accurately keep such list up-to-date, and each tag is of little use outside of that specific event.

## Notable tags

### `admin_url_consent_furality_somna`
It was used during the Furality Somna event in 2025 and informs users about Furality's bookmark feature which sent personal information to `api.fynn.ai`. The consent screen is shown before entering the world, and users must agree to continue.
